# Feature Tests

This directory contains integration/feature tests that test multiple components working together.

Feature tests should:
- Test realistic user scenarios
- Mock HTTP responses but test full request/response cycle
- Use fixtures for realistic API responses
- Test error handling across component boundaries

Example feature tests:
- Fetching and parsing market data
- Placing orders and handling responses
- Authentication flows
- Pagination and filtering
